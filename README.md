# Linux Kodachi

## Overview

**Linux Kodachi** is a security-centric operating system designed for anyone who values privacy, anonymity, and a secure computing experience. As the developer of Kodachi, my goal was to create an operating system that provides all the tools necessary for anonymous online activities while maintaining ease of use. Built on top of **Xubuntu 18.04.6** and further customized for enhanced privacy and security, Kodachi serves as a live system that leaves no trace on the host machine.

### Features at a Glance:
- **Secure by Default:** Kodachi ensures that from the moment you boot up, you're protected. With a pre-configured VPN, Tor network, and DNSCrypt service, your internet traffic is encrypted and anonymized without requiring any configuration from you.
- **Privacy Focused:** All your online connections are routed through a multi-layered protection stack, including **VPN** and **Tor**, making your identity extremely difficult to trace.
- **Live System:** Kodachi operates directly from **RAM**, ensuring that no data is written to your hard disk unless explicitly saved. Once the session is over and the system is powered down, all traces of your activity are erased.
- **User-Friendly:** Despite its advanced security features, Kodachi is designed for users of all levels. Whether you're an experienced Linux user or a beginner, you can enjoy the benefits of Kodachi with minimal setup.
- **Cryptographic Tools:** Built-in tools for file encryption, secure email communication, and instant messaging help you maintain control over your data and communications.
- **Anti-Forensic Features:** Kodachi includes measures to thwart forensic analysis, ensuring your activities remain private even if your system is physically compromised.

### *I am currently working on Kodachi 9, which will be based on Debian. The project is approximately 70% complete. I have rewritten every single script from scratch to enhance performance and functionality. This extensive effort is the reason for the time taken to release version 9.*

## Why Kodachi?

Kodachi was born out of a need to bridge the gap between user-friendly operating systems and the increasingly sophisticated world of digital privacy threats. With Kodachi, you can:
- **Browse the web anonymously** through layers of encryption and the Tor network.
- **Leave no trace** on the hardware you're using, making it perfect for environments where privacy is critical.
- **Use cutting-edge cryptographic tools** for secure communication and data storage.

It's more than just another Linux distribution—it’s a robust, lightweight operating system that puts your security and privacy first.
