This WebExtension is inspired by Self Destructing Cookies. When a tab closes, any cookies not being used are automatically deleted. Keep the ones you trust (forever/until restart) while deleting the rest. Containers Supported","fullDescription":"Please don't use reviews for bugs, support request, or feature requests. Use GitHub instead.\n\nAs of Firefox 86, strict mode is not supported at this time due to missing APIs to handle the Total Cookie Protection. Either use standard mode (this would have been the 'strict' mode pre-86), or use the custom configuration and set cookie to 'cross site tracking cookies' option (not the cross-site cookies).\n\nBefore opening a GitHub Issue, please check the troubleshooting FAQ first. Note that support may not be available for variants of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.\n\nPermission Request Explanations\n- Access your data for all websites: CAD requests this to delete cookies and other site data for all sites\n- Clear recent browsing history, cookies and related data: Ability to delete site data by domains.\n- Display notifications to you: Self explanatory.\n- Read and modify privacy settings: This setting has been removed since 3.4.0 and is kept here for historical reasons. Automatic detection of First Party Isolation support. Although the Privacy permission gives CAD \"read and modify\" permissions, NO MODIFICATIONS are done to your privacy settings, CAD only reads the setting of First Party Isolation. The privacy permission unfortunately cannot be given granular control, so this will stay for now.\n- Access browser tabs: CAD uses this permission to display the site hostname in the popup for easy whitelisting/greylisting, displaying the amount of cookies for that site, and which rules apply to that site.\n\nTake the permission wording with a grain of salt.\n\nMain Features\n- Auto Deletes Cookies from Closed (and/or discarded) Tabs\n- WhiteList/GreyList Support for domains\n- Easily Export/Import your Whitelist/Greylist and core settings\n- Clear All Cookies and site data for a Domain\n- Supports Manual Mode Cleaning from the popup\n- Easily See the Number of Cookies for a site\n- Support for Container Tabs (Firefox 53+ Only)\n\nUsage\nThis extension does not clean cookies automatically until you enable \"Auto-clean\". This gives you the chance to add sites to the WhiteList.\n\n1. Add the sites you want to keep cookies in the WhiteList (permanently) or GreyList (until Browser restart)\n2. Toggle \"Auto-clean\" in the popup or \"Automatic cleaning\" in the settings\n3. Watch those unused cookies disappear :)\n\nYou must enable cookies in the browser as this extension will replace the internal cookie manager.\n\nYou can disable Cleanup Notifications via the Settings.\n\nPopup Menu Features\nClean: This is basically a quick way of activating the Cookie Cleanup on demand. This looks at all your cookies and deletes them if they are not in any Open Tabs or the WhiteList.\nClean, include open tabs: Same thing as Cookie Cleanup except that it only deletes cookies only if they are not in the WhiteList. Open tabs are not taken into consideration.\nClear All Cookies for This Domain: Easy way to delete all cookies for one particular domain that you are on.\n\nSome things to Note:\n- This extension can clear localstorage as of version 2.1.0 and Firefox 58+. Enable it in the settings.\n\n- Even though third party cookies are cleared with this extension, it is better to disable third party cookies from the settings\n\nDocumentation\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you have any other problem, file an issue on GitHub. Maybe we can work it out. Note that support may not be available for variants of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.\n\nBTC: 16km6pFV33S6kaeb8rCaDLZXUyo3uyVnsk","weeklyDownloads":5203,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"CAD Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12748480/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/189/189656.png?modified=1622132671","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189656.jpg?modified=1622132671","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Popup"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/185/185648.png?modified=1622132671","width":413,"height":135,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/185/185648.jpg?modified=1622132671","thumbnailWidth":413,"thumbnailHeight":135,"caption":"Notifications"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/189/189657.png?modified=1622132671","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189657.jpg?modified=1622132671","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Settings"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/189/189658.png?modified=1622132671","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189658.jpg?modified=1622132671","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Expression Table"}],"contributionURL":"https://liberapay.com/CAD_Developers/?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.6096,"reviewCount":620,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/reviews/","updateDate":1670829069000},{"id":"adnauseam@rednoise.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/585/585454-32.png?modified=1654549440","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/585/585454-64.png?modified=1654549440","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/585/585454-128.png?modified=1654549440"},"name":"AdNauseam","version":"3.16.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4040916/adnauseam-3.16.0.xpi","homepageURL":"https://adnauseam.io","supportURL":"https://adnauseam.io","description":"Blocking ads and fighting back against advertising surveillance.","fullDescription":"AdNauseam not only blocks ads, it obfuscates browsing data to resist tracking by the online ad industry.

Your private bookmarks are encrypted with your chosen password. This is not an online service, and you are in control of what data leaves your machine (if at all).\n\nWhen you unlock your private bookmarks, a new 'Private Bookmarks' folder appears under 'Other Bookmarks'. You can add/remove items to it and when ready, lock it. Whenever an item is added/removed, the contents of the folder are encrypted and stored on your machine. When locked, the folder itself is removed from your browser's bookmarks collection.\n\nBy default, Private Bookmarks can only be accessed when in private browsing (to help avoid accidents), however that can be changed via the options page.\n\nBe aware!\nYou should backup your bookmarks periodically to be safe. Also, since I am bound by Firefox regarding what it allows extensions to do, I cannot guarantee complete privacy. Mobile versions of Firefox are not supported because they do not yet allow extensions access to your bookmarks the way desktop versions do.\n\nA note for Firefox Sync users\nRefrain from switching between devices while your private bookmarks are unlocked. Although personally I wasn't able to reproduce, there have been some reports of Sync getting confused and it may result in a copy of the folder remaining visible on other devices. I recommend unlocking, using, and locking all on the same device. If you encounter these issues, I also advise to trigger a sync from the Firefox menu after every lock so that you're sure the deletion of the folder goes through to your other devices. Sorry about the inconvenience.\n\nCustom folder location and name\nYou can move/rename the folder, and the next time you unlock it will appear in that location and with that name.\n\nAuto-locking\nThere are a few cases where the extension auto locks your private bookmarks:\n\n    If you have selected the \"disable outside of private browsing\" option (it is on by default) Private Bookmarks auto-locks when the last private window is closed.\n    If you have selected the \"auto-lock when idle\" option Private Bookmarks auto-locks once the system's been idle for a user-specified amount of time.\n    If you manually delete the Private Bookmarks folder.\n    If you close the browser while your private bookmarks are unlocked, the next time you open it the leftover Private Bookmarks folder is deleted immediately.\n\n\nBackup\nYou can export both encrypted/plain versions of your private bookmark data from within the options page. However, to import an encrypted backup file you must remember the password you used when that backup was made.\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\nThe following shortcuts are available:\n\n    Alt+Shift+8 opens the menu in a new tab.

Cookies downloaded by one Container are not available to other Containers. You can even integrate individual Containers with Mozilla VPN to protect your browsing and location. With the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, you can...\n\n    Sign in to two different accounts on the same site (for example, you could sign in to work email and home email in two different Container tabs.\n    Keep different kinds of browsing far away from each other (for example, you might use one Container tab for managing your Checking Account and a different Container tab for searching for new songs by your favorite band)\n    Avoid leaving social-network footprints all over the web (for example, you could use a Container tab for signing in to a social network, and use a different tab for visiting online news sites, keeping your social identity separate from tracking scripts on news sites)\n    Protect your browsing activity in individual Containers using Mozilla VPN, so you can shop while travelling abroad but check your bank account from a server in your home country.\n\n\nAfter installing the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, click the Containers icon to edit your Containers. Change their colors, names, and icons. Long-click the new tab button to open a new Container tab.\n\nFor more information on how to use Multi-Account Containers, visit our help articles:\n\n\nAll about Multi Account Containers\nMulti Container user - how to use Mozilla VPN\nVPN subscriber - how to use Multi Account Containers","weeklyDownloads":9777,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Mozilla Firefox","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/4757633/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266157.png?modified=1643906676","width":1440,"height":816,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266157.jpg?modified=1643906676","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":302},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266158.png?modified=1643906676","width":1440,"height":816,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266158.jpg?modified=1643906676","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":302},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266160.png?modified=1643906676","width":1440,"height":816,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266160.jpg?modified=1643906676","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":302},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/266/266159.png?modified=1643906676","width":1440,"height":816,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/266/266159.jpg?modified=1643906676","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":302}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.62,"reviewCount":3021,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/reviews/","updateDate":1674464467000},{"id":"switchyomega@feliscatus.addons.mozilla.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/805/805756-32.png?modified=1529986824","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/805/805756-64.png?modified=1529986824","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/805/805756-128.png?modified=1529986824"},"name":"Proxy SwitchyOmega","version":"2.5.20","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/1056777/switchyomega-2.5.20.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/FelisCatus/SwitchyOmega","supportURL":"https://github.com/FelisCatus/SwitchyOmega/issues","description":"Manage and switch between multiple proxies quickly & easily.","fullDescription":"Changing proxy settings has never been so convenient. Think SwitchyOmega as a modern version of the \"Proxy Settings\" dialog, designed to be simpler, quicker and more powerful, specially optimized for your browser.\n\nNo more digging through the advanced section in system settings. No repeated filling and clearing the proxy config dialog of your operating system. Just tell SwitchyOmega about all your proxies, and enjoy switching with one click on the popup menu. You can also teach Auto Switch to use the right proxy for the right website automatically.\n\nNOTE: Please report issues by RIGHT-clicking the extension icon and select the \"Report Issue\" in the context menu so that I can locate and fix the issue more quickly.\n\nAlternative download link (Github): https://github.com/FelisCatus/SwitchyOmega/releases\n\nSwitchyOmega is absolutely free and open source. It does not insert ads into any website. It contains absolutely no malware. It just does proxy configuration, and aims to be perfect tool of that.\n\nDisclaimer: SwitchyOmega does not come with any proxy server, VPNs or anything like that. Thus, SwitchyOmega will not magically unblock websites or protect your privacy, unless you instruct it to use a proxy server which does. You should only use trusted proxy servers, because SwitchyOmega can not protect you from bad proxies that inject ads, track you or record your password. And if you don't have a proxy server, you probably won't need SwitchyOmega. Sounds reasonable, right?\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://github.com/FelisCatus/SwitchyOmega/wiki/Privacy#english\n\nThe 2.x version features:\n* HTTP/HTTPS proxy authentication (username & password) is now supported.\n* More flexible proxy configurations: Fixed servers, multiple SwitchProfile and rule lists.\n* Reviewing and modifying proxy settings for resources that fail to load.\n* New types of condition for switching and improvements to the existing condition types.\n* Optimized performance for both PAC script generating and switching.\n* Improved user experience in options page and dropdown menu.\n* Many Bug fixes and improvements. More testing.\n\n== Translations ==\nYou can help improve the translation of SwitchyOmega or translate it into your language on Weblate:\nhttps://hosted.weblate.org/engage/switchyomega/?utm_source=widget\n\nCONFLICTS: SwitchyOmega will conflict with other extensions trying to control the proxy settings. Such conflicts are caused by the design of the browser and thus cannot be avoided. When SwitchyOmega has a higher priority, it can be configured to voluntarily give back the control by selecting the [System Proxy] item in the popup menu. Otherwise, you will see a red badge on the SwitchyOmega icon indicating insufficient priority. Re-installing SwitchyOmega should raise its priority, providing a possible workaround.","weeklyDownloads":4475,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Firefox user 12962115","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12962115/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/183/183857.png?modified=1622132726","width":700,"height":258,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/183/183857.jpg?modified=1622132726","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":196,"caption":"Configure all your proxies in one place."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/183/183855.png?modified=1622132726","width":232,"height":308,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/183/183855.jpg?modified=1622132726","thumbnailWidth":232,"thumbnailHeight":308,"caption":"Switch easily between proxies on the popup menu."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/183/183856.png?modified=1622132726","width":700,"height":258,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/183/183856.jpg?modified=1622132726","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":196,"caption":"Customize proxies for different URLs using Auto Switch."}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6457,"reviewCount":184,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/switchyomega/reviews/","updateDate":1535342109000},{"id":"jid1-5Fs7iTLscUaZBgwr@jetpack","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/497/497366-32.png?modified=1645261897","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/497/497366-64.png?modified=1645261897","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/497/497366-128.png?modified=1645261897"},"name":"Disable WebRTC","version":"1.0.23","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3551985/happy_bonobo_disable_webrtc-1.0.23.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/ChrisAntaki/disable-webrtc-firefox","supportURL":null,"description":"WebRTC leaks your actual IP addresses from behind your VPN, by default.","fullDescription":"WebRTC allows websites to get your actual IP address from behind your VPN.

Challenges are solved by clicking on the extension button at the bottom of the reCAPTCHA widget.\n\nIt is not guaranteed that challenges are always solved, the limitations of the technology need to be considered.\n\nThe continued development of Buster is made possible thanks to the support of awesome backers. If you'd like to join them, please consider contributing with Patreon, PayPal or Bitcoin.\n\nClient app\n\nThe success rate of the extension can be improved by simulating user interactions with the help of a client app. Follow the instructions from the extension's options to download and install the client app on Windows, Linux and macOS.\n\nSolving more than a couple of reCAPTCHA challenges a day may lead to a temporary block, regardless of your use of the extension.

HTTP protocol requires the full URL when the request is made via proxy. Your CMS must be aware of that.\n\n2. All Nameservers and IPs are cached for six hours. If you change your domain's settings, please wait the cache to expire.\n\n3. HTTPS is not working. We are searching for the solution.","weeklyDownloads":14,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"John Galt","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11275954/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/185/185583.png?modified=1622132719","width":700,"height":365,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/185/185583.jpg?modified=1622132719","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":278,"caption":"http://nx.bit/"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/185/185584.png?modified=1622132719","width":700,"height":381,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/185/185584.jpg?modified=1622132719","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":290,"caption":"http://rutracker.lib/"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.4444,"reviewCount":18,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/peername/reviews/","updateDate":1575567310000},{"id":"jid1-BYl3kts609WbCw@jetpack","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/631/631996-32.png?modified=1509038421","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/631/631996-64.png?modified=1509038421","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/631/631996-128.png?modified=1509038421"},"name":"Yet Another Bitcoin Price Ticker","version":"1.5.3","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/1073444/yabpt-1.5.3.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/RockyTV/yabpt","supportURL":"https://github.com/RockyTV/yabpt/issues","description":"A simple bitcoin price ticker, powered by Blockchain.info.","fullDescription":"Yet Another Bitcoin Price Ticker is a simple extension that provides information about the current price of a single Bitcoin in over 15 currencies, all that displayed in a nice looking badge on your browser.\n\n\n\n\nPowered by Blockchain.info.\nLike it?
